## Technology \& Engineering

I'm a software engineer from Paraguay with a strong background in open source, distributed systems, and networking. With over a decade of experience working with Golang, I've developed and maintained scalable platforms, contributed to major open source projects, and led engineering efforts across different verticals—including cloud infrastructure, API management and VFX rendering. My current focus is [CrowdLlama](https://github.com/matiasinsaurralde/crowdllama), an open source project enabling distributed inference through peer-to-peer networks. I welcome opportunities for consulting, collaborating on open source projects, and providing technical mentorship.

## Jazz \& Cultural Initiatives

Beyond my work in technology, I actively support the jazz music scene in Paraguay through [Amigos del Jazz](https://www.instagram.com/amigosdeljazzpy/), contributing to a range of projects that foster cultural growth and artistic collaboration.

- In 2024, we supported the publication of ["Música Popular Instrumental y Jazz del Paraguay"](https://www.abc.com.py/espectaculos/musica/2024/12/24/bruno-munoz-compilo-en-un-libro-mucha-musica-que-desborda-de-energia/), the first-ever book compiling sheet music for Paraguayan popular music and jazz. This landmark project, led by Bruno Muñoz, features 145 works from multiple generations of Paraguayan composers and serves as a vital resource for musicians, educators, and researchers interested in the country's rich musical heritage.
- We've supported the annual [Jazz Sudaca festival](https://www.instagram.com/festivaljazzsudaca/), a vibrant event that brings together leading jazz and contemporary musicians from Paraguay and across South America. The festival offers concerts, workshops, and cultural exchanges, helping to build a thriving and inclusive jazz community in the region.
- We've funded the release of the vinyl album for [Ensamble Palito Miranda](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/artist/7l7DZRcAqDdVMhVLs1ysmX), a tribute to the iconic Paraguayan jazz musician [Palito Miranda](https://www.portalguarani.com/2564_palito_miranda__.html). This project not only honors Miranda's influential legacy—spanning his work as a performer, educator, and cultural bridge between Paraguay and Brazil—but also marks the launch of Polka Blue, the country's first jazz and instrumental music record label. The album features original arrangements and celebrates the ongoing evolution of Paraguayan jazz.

Through these and other initiatives, Amigos del Jazz continues to play a key role in preserving, promoting, and innovating within Paraguay’s jazz and instrumental music scene.

## Investment \& Entrepreneurship

My entrepreneurial journey includes creating [Táva Comedor](https://instagram.com/tavacomedor), a restaurant recognized in [Lonely Planet's "Best in Travel 2025"](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-travel) and featured by [El País](https://elpais.com/elviajero/lonely-planet/2024-11-21/paraguay-el-destino-a-descubrir-en-america-del-sur.html) for its role in putting Paraguay on the culinary map.

Táva Comedor stands out in Asunción as a contemporary bistró that redefines Paraguayan cuisine by blending tradition with creativity. The restaurant is celebrated for its inventive menu, which changes between lunch and dinner and highlights local ingredients such as river fish, native meats, and seasonal produce. Tava’s approach emphasizes accessibility and community, offering high-quality dishes in a welcoming, unpretentious setting. The venue is also known for hosting live music events, fostering a vibrant cultural atmosphere.

Alongside hospitality, I invest in early-stage businesses in different industries and am involved with funds that help innovative enterprises grow.

## Civic Engagement

My civic engagement centers on advancing transparency, digital rights, and responsible technology policy in Paraguay. Over the years, I’ve been an active voice on issues like open government data, public technology budgets, and digital security—often sharing thoughts in national media and on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@matiasbaruch). My work has included digging into public infrastructure for security gaps and advocating for better cybersecurity laws.

I am also recognized for my activism around freedom of expression and open access to information, having challenged censorship attempts and promoted community-driven solutions to technology challenges. In 2020, I was honored with the ["Periodistas por la transparencia" award](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=763554181116493&id=331023807702868&_rdr), supported by USAID, in recognition of my contributions to transparency and public accountability in Paraguay. These experiences reflect my commitment to leveraging technology as a tool for social good and civic empowerment.
