## Technology \& Engineering

I’m a software engineer from Paraguay with a strong background in open source, distributed systems, and networking. With over a decade of experience developing in [Go](https://go.dev), I’ve built and maintained scalable platforms, contributed to major open source initiatives, and led engineering efforts across multiple domains—including cloud infrastructure, API management, and VFX rendering. My current focus is [CrowdLlama](https://github.com/matiasinsaurralde/crowdllama), an open source project that enables distributed inference through peer-to-peer networks. I’m open to consulting engagements, collaborations in open source development, and opportunities to provide technical mentorship.

## Jazz \& Cultural Initiatives

Beyond my work in technology, I actively support the jazz music scene in Paraguay through [Amigos del Jazz](https://www.instagram.com/amigosdeljazzpy/), contributing to projects fostering cultural growth and artistic collaboration.

- In 2024, we supported the publication of ["Música Popular Instrumental y Jazz del Paraguay"](https://www.abc.com.py/espectaculos/musica/2024/12/24/bruno-munoz-compilo-en-un-libro-mucha-musica-que-desborda-de-energia/), the first book compiling sheet music for Paraguayan popular music and jazz. This landmark project, led by Bruno Muñoz, features 145 works drawn from multiple generations of Paraguayan composers and serves as a vital resource for musicians, educators, and researchers interested in the country’s rich musical heritage.
- We've supported the annual [Jazz Sudaca festival](https://www.instagram.com/festivaljazzsudaca/), a vibrant event that brings together leading jazz and contemporary musicians from Paraguay and across South America. The festival offers concerts, workshops, and cultural exchanges, helping to build a thriving and inclusive jazz community in the region.
- We've funded the release of the vinyl album for [Ensamble Palito Miranda](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/artist/7l7DZRcAqDdVMhVLs1ysmX), a tribute to the iconic Paraguayan jazz musician [Palito Miranda](https://www.portalguarani.com/2564_palito_miranda__.html). This project not only honors Miranda’s influential legacy—spanning his work as a performer, educator, and cultural bridge between Paraguay and Brazil—but also marks the launch of Polka Blue, the country’s first jazz and instrumental music record label. The album features original arrangements and celebrates the ongoing evolution of Paraguayan jazz.

Through these and other initiatives, Amigos del Jazz continues to play a key role in preserving, promoting, and innovating within Paraguay’s jazz and instrumental music scene.

## Investment \& Entrepreneurship

My entrepreneurial journey includes creating [Táva Comedor](https://instagram.com/tavacomedor), a restaurant recognized in [Lonely Planet's "Best in Travel 2025"](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-travel) and featured by [El País](https://elpais.com/elviajero/lonely-planet/2024-11-21/paraguay-el-destino-a-descubrir-en-america-del-sur.html) for its role in putting Paraguay on the culinary map.

Located in Asunción, Táva Comedor is a contemporary bistró that reimagines Paraguayan cuisine by blending tradition with creativity. Its rotating menu showcases local ingredients—river fish, native meats, and seasonal produce—offering distinct experiences between lunch and dinner. Táva’s philosophy centers on accessibility and community, delivering refined yet approachable dining in a warm, unpretentious setting. The space also hosts live music events, fostering a vibrant intersection of gastronomy and culture.

Beyond hospitality, I invest in early-stage ventures across various industries and collaborate with funds that support the growth of innovative enterprises.

## Civic Engagement

My civic engagement focuses on advancing transparency, digital rights, and responsible technology policy in Paraguay. Over the years, I’ve been an active voice on open government data, public technology budgets, and digital security—regularly sharing insights in national media and on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@matiasbaruch). My work includes investigating public infrastructure for security gaps and advocating for stronger cybersecurity frameworks.

I’m also known for my activism in defense of freedom of expression and open access to information, having challenged censorship efforts and promoted community-driven approaches to technology and transparency. In 2020, I received the  ["Periodistas por la transparencia" award](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=763554181116493&id=331023807702868&_rdr), supported by USAID, recognizing my contributions to public accountability in Paraguay. These experiences reflect my commitment to using technology as a force for social good and civic empowerment.
